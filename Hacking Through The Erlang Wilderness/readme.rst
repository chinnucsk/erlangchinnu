-----------------------
Purpose
-----------------------

I'm experimenting with Erlang, but I'm finding that I forget things, unless I write them down. I'm sharing my experiences here, and especially the things that were difficult and frustrating. 

For example, in Episode-02_, I intentionally take the reader down several dead-ends as we try to noodle out how to create an erlang application. Along the way, I introduce some interesting utilities and features that will become more useful in later episodes. You see, even though I've read all 3 erlang books (multiple times), I still find the 'erlang' thing a little awkward. 

Hopefully, these simple posts will help others as much as they are helping me.


-----------------------
Episodes
-----------------------
 * Episode-00_ : Configure a VMWare guest vm
 * *Episode-01_ : (deprecated) Install Erlang and Tools Like Faxien, Sinan, and Rebar*
 * Episode-02_ : Create a basic Erlang App
 * Episode-03_ : Create a 'Time Server' App
 * Episode-04_ : Create a Webmachine Demo App (Webmachine Part I)
 * Episode-05_ : Create a Webmachine Rest Endpoint (Webmachine Part 2)
 * Episode-06_ : [in-progress] Create an Mnesia based application

-----------------------
Ideas For Future Demos
-----------------------
 * Erlang error/exception handling
 * ETS, DTS, Mnesia Demo
 * Use OTP to manage external processes (mysql, java, tomcat, etc.)
 * Connect erlang app to a sql server like mysql or postgres
 * Connect erlang app to a riak cluster
 * Connect erlang app to a sclaris cluster
 * Create a minimalist erlang app server using lua
